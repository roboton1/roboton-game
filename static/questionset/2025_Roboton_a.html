His master plan of tricking the US public into thinking he was an earnest man, that hoped everyone would succeed. He'd played them like fiddles. With his new house and senate supermajorities, he could instate his master plan. First, he would pass a bill that knocks down every Christian church in America and use the rubble to build monuments to Allah. Next, he was going to raise taxes to 101% percent on billionaires, and use the money to buy every school and start teaching communist history. Finally, he would amend the constitution, and remove every odd-numbered amendment, making the American population bend to his every whim (probably, he hadn't thought that far yet).
